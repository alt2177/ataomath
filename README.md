# My Custom LaTeX commands: ataomath

A package so that I don't have to copy-paste the same custom commands into each new `.tex` file.

**Note: this package requires the `mathtools` package. I haven't quite figured out how to set up the dependency structure
of a package yet, so any help is appreciated!**
